# Handwritten Digit Recognition
Playing around with the handwritten digit recognition project found at https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-deep-learning-project-handwritten-digit-recognition/.
Full credit for the neural network code goes to data-flair.training. This project is for experimenting with different parameters and testing Nvidia CUDA capabilities with tensorflow-gpu.
